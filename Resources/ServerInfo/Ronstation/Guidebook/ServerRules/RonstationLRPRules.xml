  # Server Rules
  Welcome to Ronstation, a Space Station 14 server. Be sure to check out our discord server: https://discord.gg/q9vm8tfxc9.

  This is a roleplay server, meaning that roleplay rules apply.

  Space Station 14 is not like most games. Many rules are designed to require roleplay, and not all rules are intuitive. Please take the time to read and understand the rules before you play so that you aren't surprised. Some of our rules are zero tolerance rules, meaning that a violation will result in an indefinite ban without any warning. Game admins will treat you as if you have read the rules, even if you have not.

  ## Core Rules
  These rules apply at all times, including between rounds.

  ### 1.: The rules must be followed to the spirit, not the letter (administration discretion applies).
  These rules are not perfect. The rules attempt to clearly communicate what the admin team intends to be allowed and prohibited, but there are likely loopholes or other flaws that can be "lawyered". Don't attempt to manipulate the interpretation of the rules to suit your personal goals or to degrade the experience of other players. If you are unsure of something, follow the more restrictive option until you are able to ask an admin and get clarification.

  Admins may override rules if it is in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large. However, they must answer for use of this privilege and be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise it.

  ### 2.: Please show mutual respect and don't be a jerk.
  Show respect to everyone, regardless of who they are. Don't be here for the purpose of causing problems or otherwise negatively impacting the community. No one should be here for the purpose of harming someone else's experience.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC2"]
  ### 3.: Do not incite hatred or import politics and (real-world) religion, please. We're not here for quarelling.
  Inciting hatred (hate speech, bigoted or otherwise discriminatory attitudes, insensitive use of slurs, et cetera), politics, or real-world religion is very detrimental to the community and it's wellbeing, and is therefore STRICTLY PROHIBITED. We can not tolerate any form of quarelling over a political or religious dispute; and over someone's race, sexuality, gender, ethnicity, and the like.

  VIOLATIONS OF THIS RULE MIGHT WARRANT A PERMANENT BAN IF SEVERE ENOUGH.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC3"]
  ### 4.: Please no sexual content, shock content, and erotic roleplay. We have children here.
  Any form of erotic roleplay (ERP) and sexual content is prohibited. This includes direct and indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions. Slight leeway is given to insults, but this rule is otherwise strictly enforced.

  In-game romantic relationships should not become the focus of the game for you and anyone else involved.

  Things that appear to be intended to or are likely to disturb players out of character are considered shock content and are prohibited as a result.

  VIOLATIONS OF THIS RULE MIGHT WARRANT A PERMANENT BAN IF SEVERE ENOUGH.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC4"]
  ### 5.: Do not use out-of-character (OOC) or local-out-of-character (LOOC) channels, or out of game methods to communicate with other players during the current round (metacomming).
  Please do not utilize any external means (chatrooms, voice, imagery, in-person communications) to talk to other players who are connected to the same server during the round. Even if information is not being shared or abused, such communications would still be considered violations of the rule.

  local-out-of-character (LOOC) and out-of-character (OOC) channels are meant for things that don't relate to the current round. Using these channels to share round information (referred to as "IC in OOC" or informally "ick ock") may fall under metacommunications (thus violating this rule).

  The only exemptions to this rule is when:
    1. The round ends and/or has not started.
    2. When you are teaching a new player, you may do so via in-game methods; leeway is given if you are going to teach the player out-of-character (OOC) or meta concepts (keyboard shortcuts, UI buttons, *et cetera*) via local-out-of-character (LOOC) channels.

  VIOLATIONS OF THIS RULE MIGHT WARRANT A PERMANENT BAN IF SEVERE ENOUGH.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC5"]
  ### 6.: Do not attempt to evade bans.
  There is an appeal channel in our discord, so if you feel that you have been banned under unfair terms, feel free to exercise your privilege to do so.

  However, any attemt to circumvent or bypass a game ban will result in additional ban-time or even a voucher ban if done in a severe or repeated pattern. Attempting to evade role bans by gaining access to or working in the capacity of a job you are banned from will result in a game ban (antagonists who impersonate or take over a role which they are banned from to aid in their goals are not considered to be evading their role ban). These bans are applied even if the evasion attempt is unsuccessful.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC6"]
  ### 7.: English only, or proper communication becomes impossible.
  Only english is permitted, both in-character and out-of-character. You must be fluent in english enough to be capable of communicating with other people (especially game administrators when necessary). If we feel that you are not fluent in english enough, you may be banned.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC7"]
  ### 8.: Please do not exploit the game, use cheats, macros, or multiple accounts.
  Basically do not abuse the game to do unintended things in order to gain an unfair advantage, and/or greatly harm the game or the players' experience. Should you encounter a bug, immediately ahelp the administrators and we will have it taken care of.
  This rule prohibits, but is not limited to the following:
    1. bugs and exploits which have effects that persist beyond the current round,
    2. intentionally used bugs, exploits, and unintended behaviors which give the user an advantage over players who do not use them, even if their effects do not persist across rounds,
    3. evading or bypassing afk detection,
    4. anything which results in gaining elevated privileges, including admin permissions,
    5. external tools and client modifications, including macros, and
    6. anything which prevents another player who is not game banned from being able to play on the servers, not including in-character actions that do not persist across rounds
    7. Use of multiple accounts (multikeying). Violations of this rule may result in all of your accounts being taken action by administration (including bans if necessary). You are responsible for everything done on and with your account. You are just as responsible for actions taken by other people using your account as you would be had you taken the actions themselves.

  If you lose access to an account, you must contact game admins on our discord by notifying admins before using a new account to connect to the server. Your message to game admins must include the username of your old account.
  Creating a new account while your current account is banned will be considered ban evasion and be banned accordingly (see core rule 6 for more information).

  VIOLATIONS OF THIS RULE MIGHT WARRANT A PERMANENT BAN IF SEVERE ENOUGH.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC8"]
  ### 9.: Kindly do not abuse or ignore admin messages.
  Admin help, or "ahelp", is the system used by admins to communicate with specific players in the game. Only use admin help for things requiring admin attention. If you ignore messages admins send to you via ahelp, or disconnect during an ahelp, you may be banned. If you urgently need to leave during an ahelp, please do inform us first, then feel free to leave (no need to await confirmation); if you do so, you might likely need to resolve this later in our discord.
  This rule prohibits usage of the Admin help system for the following:
    1. Using the ahelps just to check for any online administrators (adminchecking).
    2. be hostile/aggressive during conversations with administrators.
    3. request events.
    4. asking for what event is being conducted for both during and after the round.
    5. spamming messages, wether it be the same issue, another related or unrelated issue, or any random topics.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC9"]
  ### 10.: Players must be and act at least 16 years old.
  All players must be at least 16 years old, both chronological and mentally. Additionally, all players must act at least as mature as a 16 year old. Administration may ban someone if we believe is acting less mature than a 16 year old, even if the player is known to be older than 16 years old.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRC10"]

  ## Roleplay Rules
  These rules only apply during a round. A round ends only when the round summary has appeared. All of these rules apply fully until the moment that the round summary appears, even while the arrivals shuttle is in transit.

  The deathmatch and sandbox game modes are exempt from these rules. Sandbox game mode has it's own ruleset. Players who choose to not follow these rules are entirely responsible for knowing if an exempt game mode is active.

  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.

  See the list of [textlink="role types" link="RoleTypes"] for more information about the different types of roles.

  ### 1.: This is a roleplaying game. Try to roleplay as an in-universe character, not a player playing the game.
  This is a game where you are roleplaying as an employee in a space-station. Your words and actions in-game should be distinguishable as an in-universe character, and not a person playing the game. Playstyles that disregard all opportunities for engagement and roleplay can be met with administrative action.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR1"]

  ### 2.: Pick a realistic name.
  In-character names should be able to look like it would have been in a birth-certificate. They should also not break the immersion within the setting.
  The rules for character names include:
  1. No names of people or characters from the real world.
  2. No titles or honorifics.
  3. Must follow all other rules.
  4. Meta names, such as names which are intentionally hard to read/spell, references to in-game mechanics or out-of-character terminology and/or taking advantage of such, historical/famous media, and any form of nonsensical or low-effort name.
  Clowns and mimes are given some leeway in choosing their names, within reason and as long as immersion isn't broken.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR2"]

  ### 3.: Character descriptions should be used properly.
  Character descriptions should only contain information that any other character couldn't notice at a glance. Character description should not contain any information about a feature (like personality, past, and so on) that isn't immediately apparent.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR3"]

  ### 4.: Do not use information gained outside in-character means (metagaming).
  Usage of information gained outside of in-character means for the purpose of gaining an unfair advantage or breaking the round. Otherwise, characters are allowed to know certain mechanics, as well as keep persistent friendships or relationships with other characters whn not for the purpose of unfair advantage and within in-character or lore reason.

  Any and all forms of metacommunications (see core rule 5 for more information) falls under this rule.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR4"]

  ### 5.: Do not interfere with arrivals or cryosleep.
  The cryosleep area, arrivals terminal/station, the arrivals shuttle, and the area immediately around the arrivals shuttle at the station (usually referred to as simply "arrivals") are off-limits to antagonistic activity or damage (even to antagonist). Do not prevent or otherwise attempt to prevent people from safely arriving to the station.

  The only exemption to this rule is that antagonists are allowed to perform mass station sabotage if there is no reasonable way to limit the damage of the mass station sabotage. This exemption only applies to damage that is a direct result of the mass station sabotage.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR5"]

  ### 6.: Please kindly follow reasonable escalation. Don't immediately kill someone over a stupid reason.
  Do not escalate a conflict based on a poor or unreasonable assumption. Escalation should typically follow steps or a pattern of conflict types similar to:
  - Step 1: Verbal conflict.
  - Step 2: Non-Harmful conflict.
  - Step 3: Non-Lethal conflict.
  - Step 4: Lethal conflict.
  - Step 5: Permanently lethal conflict.
  Antagonists and most free-agent roles are fully exempt from escalation rules, unless otherwise noted. Non-antagonists who are in conflict with antagonists are not exempt. Escalation rules aren't usually enforced against non-player-controlled entities (catatonic players detectable via purple text when examining) and/or animals defined as "pests" (mice, mothroaches, *et cetera*), but players will be held responsible for rule violations, even if they don't realize that a character or animal was controlled by another player.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR6"]

  ### 7.: Stick to your role. Don't abandon your role.
  Please do not join the round as a role that you don't intend to play. Do not enable antagonist roles that you don't intend to play. Abandoning a role includes not completing tasks that the role is expected to do, in addition to things like leaving the game.

  Do not abandon your role if you did not join as an antagonist (antag-rolling). Doing so will make things really unfair for people waiting to play as an antagonist and may very often lead to a ban from playing as antagonist roles.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR7"]

  ### 8.: Silicons must follow silicon laws.
  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, the Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules.

  Silicons without laws are exempt from this rule, due to them having now laws, but are not exempt from other rules.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR8"]

  ### 9.: Don't powergame, or you'll ruin rounds!
  Powergaming is defined as using an in-game character mechanic or game knowledge to give your own character an advantage at the expense of everyone else. As powergaming generally ruins rounds, it is usually prohibited.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR9"]

  ### 10.: Important roles (command, security, and most antagonists) require more than minimum effort of roleplay.
  Command, security, and most antagonist roles are not learning roles. Players playing as members of command and security, as well as most antagonist roles, must be competent and are expected to know game basics and be more familiar with the server rules than a new player. Abuse of power as a member of command or security can result in a role ban, or even a game ban if severe enough.

  Antagonists may not cause excessive death, damage, or destruction beyond your objectives. While an antagonist may kill someone in bona-fide self defense, taking steps to permanently round remove many people who are no longer an immediate threat to you is almost always excessive, even if done to prevent yourself from being discovered. Antagonists may still cause a reasonable level of disruption to the station that is proportional to their objectives.

  Note that certain types of roles have their own rules. Team antagonists may not work against their own team. Certain antagonist and free-agent roles, as well as familiars, have restrictions that have to be followed.
  [textlink="More information." link="RuleRR10"]

  ## Silicon Rules
  You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon. For players who are silicons, these Silicon Rules override all roleplay rules if there is any conflict. Silicon Rules do not override core rules.

  - [textlink="1. Your silicon laws are rules" link="RuleS1"]
  - [textlink="2. Laws must be prioritized by their order" link="RuleS2"]
  - [textlink="3. Laws can redefine terms used in other laws" link="RuleS3"]
  - [textlink="4. You cannot request or allow a law change" link="RuleS4"]
  - [textlink="5. You are a free agent if you have no laws" link="RuleS5"]
  - [textlink="6. You are not required to follow orders which are extremely unreasonable" link="RuleS6"]
  - [textlink="7. You must remain consistent with your interpretation of laws" link="RuleS7"]
  - [textlink="8. Your HUD determines who is crew" link="RuleS8"]
  - [textlink="9. Harm refers to physical harm, prioritized by immediacy and likelihood" link="RuleS9"]
  - [textlink="10. You may determine how you resolve conflicts between orders" link="RuleS10"]

  ## Sandbox rules.
  These rules apply to an administrator-spawned gamemode called "sandbox". This ruleset, as well as the core ruleset applies. Violation can result in administrative action.

  ### 1. Do not grief.
  Don't delete players without a reasonable excuse. Don't cause excessive lag or otherwise make the game unplayable. If someone tells you to stop, then please stop.

  ### 2. Do not cause excessive damage to the station.
  Do not destroy, split, or otherwise make parts of the station uninhabitatable, especially in regards to the arrivals system and cryosleep. Players do play on the station and destruction of the station will frustrate them.
